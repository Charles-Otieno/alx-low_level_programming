0x08 - C Recursion
This repository contains solutions to various exercises and examples related to recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It can be a powerful tool for solving problems that have a repetitive or self-similar structure.

Description
The exercises and examples in this repository aim to provide a better understanding of recursion and its applications in C programming. They cover topics such as:

Basic recursion: understanding the concept of recursion and its implementation in C.
Recursive functions: creating functions that call themselves to solve a problem.
Recursive data structures: exploring recursive data structures, such as linked lists and binary trees.
Recursive algorithms: implementing recursive algorithms, such as factorial, Fibonacci sequence, and searching/sorting algorithms.
Files
The repository contains the following files and directories:

0-recursion.c: Example code demonstrating a basic recursive function.
1-print_rev_recursion.c: Example code for printing a string in reverse using recursion.
2-strlen_recursion.c: Example code for calculating the length of a string using recursion.
3-factorial.c: Example code for calculating the factorial of a number using recursion.
4-pow_recursion.c: Example code for calculating the power of a number using recursion.
5-sqrt_recursion.c: Example code for calculating the square root of a number using recursion.
6-is_prime_number.c: Example code for checking if a number is prime using recursion.
7-is_palindrome.c: Example code for checking if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
