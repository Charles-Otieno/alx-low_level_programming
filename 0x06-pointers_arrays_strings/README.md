## Description

This project focuses on practicing C programming concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings. It includes functions that implement tasks like string concatenation, string comparison, array reversal, string transformation, and more.

## Functions

The following functions are included in this project:

1. `_strcat`: Concatenates two strings.
2. `_strncat`: Concatenates two strings using at most `n` bytes from the source.
3. `_strncpy`: Copies a string up to `n` characters.
4. `_strcmp`: Compares two strings.
5. `reverse_array`: Reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. `string_toupper`: Converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.
7. `cap_string`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
8. `leet`: Encodes a string into "1337" speak.
9. `rot13`: Encodes a string using the ROT13 cipher.
10. `print_number`: Prints an integer to the standard output.
11. `infinite_add`: Adds two numbers represented as strings.
12. `print_buffer`: Prints the content of a buffer in a formatted manner.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., gcc) by running the following command:

   ```sh
   gcc -o program_name file_name.c
   ```

   Replace `program_name` with the desired executable name and `file_name.c` with the name of the C file you want to compile.

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./program_name
   ```

   Replace `program_name` with the name of the compiled executable.

5. Follow the prompts or refer to the code comments to understand the functionality of each function.
