Debugging Practice: 0x03-debugging
This directory contains several debugging tasks to help improve your skills in identifying and fixing issues in C programs. Each task involves understanding and modifying existing code to achieve the desired functionality. The tasks cover various aspects of debugging, such as infinite loops, logical errors, and handling leap years.

Task 1: Multiple Mains
File(s): 0-main.c, main.h

In this task, you need to create a test case for the positive_or_negative() function. The provided main.c file is used to test the function, but it contains an issue causing an infinite loop. Your goal is to comment out the problematic code and ensure the program runs correctly.

Task 2: 0 > 972?
File(s): 2-main.c, 2-largest_number.c, main.h

This task involves fixing a logical error in the code that prints the largest of three integers. The existing code is not correctly determining the largest number. Your task is to modify the largest_number() function in 2-largest_number.c to correctly find the largest integer among the given values.

Task 3: Leap Year
File(s): 3-main_a.c, 3-main_b.c, 3-convert_day.c, 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h

In this task, you will work with a program that converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, considering leap years. The provided code contains a bug that prevents it from handling leap years correctly. Your goal is to fix the print_remaining_days() function in 3-print_remaining_days.c so that it produces accurate output for all date scenarios, including leap years.

These tasks are designed to enhance your debugging skills and familiarize you with common issues encountered in programming. By successfully completing these tasks, you'll gain valuable experience in identifying and resolving bugs, which is a crucial skill for any software developer.

Feel free to refer to the provided code files for each task and make the necessary modifications to achieve the desired functionality.

Happy debugging!
