# ALX Low-Level Programming - Functions and Nested Loops

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository's `0x02-functions_nested_loops` directory. This directory contains a collection of programs and functions that demonstrate various concepts related to functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Programs and Functions

### 1. `_putchar`

- **File:** `_putchar.c`
- This program demonstrates how to print the `_putchar` string followed by a new line using the custom `_putchar` function.

### 2. `print_alphabet`

- **File:** `1-print_alphabet.c`
- This function prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line.

### 3. `print_alphabet_x10`

- **File:** `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`
- This function prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each followed by a new line.

### 4. `islower`

- **File:** `3-islower.c`
- This function checks if a character is a lowercase letter and returns either 1 (true) or 0 (false).

### 5. `isalpha`

- **File:** `4-isalpha.c`
- This function checks if a character is an alphabetic letter and returns either 1 (true) or 0 (false).

### 6. `print_sign`

- **File:** `5-sign.c`
- This function prints the sign of a number (+, -, or 0).

### 7. `int_abs`

- **File:** `6-abs.c`
- This function computes the absolute value of an integer.

### 8. `print_last_digit`

- **File:** `7-print_last_digit.c`
- This function prints the last digit of a number.

### 9. `jack_bauer`

- **File:** `8-24_hours.c`
- This function prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

### 10. `times_table`

- **File:** `9-times_table.c`
- This function prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

### 11. `add`

- **File:** `10-add.c`
- This function adds two integers and returns the result.

### 12. `print_to_98`

- **File:** `11-print_to_98.c`
- This function prints all natural numbers from n to 98, each followed by a new line.

### 13. `times_table`

- **File:** `12-times_table.c`
- This function prints the n times table, starting with 0.

### 14. `sum_of_multiples`

- **File:** `13-sum_of_multiples.c`
- This program computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

### 15. `print_fibonacci`

- **File:** `14-fibonacci.c`
- This program prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

### 16. `even_fibonacci_sum`

- **File:** `15-even_fibonacci.c`
- This program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, followed by a new line.

### 17. `print_first_98_fibonacci`

- **File:** `16-fibonacci.c`
- This program finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

## Getting Started
